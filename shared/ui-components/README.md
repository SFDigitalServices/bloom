# Bloom UI Components

This package is the home of the core UI components for the Bloom affordable housing system, meant to be imported from one or more applications that provide the end-user interface.

## Types of Components

Bloom components have been design with the principles of [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) in mind, and some of the directory structure and naming conventions are based on that.

There are also Page Components as a distinct class, which represent larger combinations of components (atomic: organisms) that are meant to be directly imported into specific pages in the system (e.g. a home page).

## Storybook

The UI components package includes [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for easy browsing of the component tree, and is the best way to get started understand what's available.

#### Note: Component stories are currently not complete, so it's best to look through the directory structure and reference apps as well.
